## About

Inspired by [Cube](http://cubeengine.com/) and [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/) this project had as goal to create a tiny 3d multiplayer shooter with Minecraft editing and Cube gameplay. 

Currently all work on this project has stopped and it will not be updated anymore.

## Features

* Minecraft like editing on a 256x256x256 cube map
* Octree scene management
* Simple scripting language
* Simple collision detection
* Fixed pipline OpenGL renderer with static directional lighting
